This is a personal project of an implementation of a Butcher Shop website. The purpose of this project was to become more comfortable with HTML/CSS/Javascript while having some fun implementing an old-fashioned newspaper design. The design of the website was inspired by the video game, Red Dead Redemption 2's Catalogue Menu Design as well as the website, SeaHarvest.
